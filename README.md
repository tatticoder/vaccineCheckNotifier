## Motivation to use Google App script
Initially I planned to use Node JS as backend service for this project which would have worked fine but I would need to host it and maintain a database for it. Google sheets were  enought for me as a database and not having to pay for hosting services for this project sounded appealing so I decided to used it as a backend service.
